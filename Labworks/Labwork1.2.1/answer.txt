In the most basic terms, a grid is a structure comprising a series of lines (vertical or intersecting) 
that divide a page into columns or modules.

The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels.
There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be used separately or in tandem.
